# OpenCV-Playing-Card-Detector
This is a Python program that uses OpenCV to detect and identify playing cards from a PiCamera video feed on a Raspberry Pi. Check out the YouTube video that describes what it does and how it works:

## Files
CardDetector.py contains the main script

Cards.py has classes and functions that are used by CardDetector.py

PiVideoStream.py creates a video stream from the PiCamera, and is used by CardDetector.py

Rank_Suit_Isolator.py is a standalone script that can be used to isolate the rank and suit from a set of cards to create train images

Card_Imgs contains all the train images of the card ranks and suits

## Dependencies
OpenCV-Python 3.2.0 and numpy 1.8.2:

See https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/18/install-guide-raspberry-pi-3-raspbian-jessie-opencv-3/
for how to build and install OpenCV-Python on the Raspberry Pi


picamera library
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-picamera python3-picamera
```

## Usage
Download this repository to a directory and run CardDetector.py from that directory. Cards need to be placed on a dark background for the detector to work.
